# INTRODUCTION

Hello üòâ dear folks, I am Mohammed Rizwan enrolled in BCA (Bachelor's of Computer Applications) and currently learning Web Development especially JavaScript and its Framework, DSA, and Blockchain. I love to try new things and I am here to share the problems which I had faced in my tech career and will give my POV on some topics.

# From January to December | Exploring multiple things

## 1\. Explored the WEB 3.0 and its concepts

So, I was in semester 3 when I got to know about Blockchain, IoT, Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc. So I decided to explore these fields but first of all, I don't understand how to learn this big-new things where are the core basics like where to start initially ü§î

So I decided to learn about Blockchain and how smart contracts are been written and cryptography and mining works

There is a great youtube channel that I would refer to that is [Code Eater](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkSQ_IQHqzygX0gGr7-SRwg) by Kshitij Srivastava in Hindi. This channel is beginner friendly for those who want to learn blockchain and its basics.

## 2\. Confused Between Jobs and Studies üòÅ

I am from Tier-3 College, where the placement scenario is like you know about üòä. So I was too confused between doing a job/internship or going abroad for masters.

I had looked much advice from my collegues and friends, but still, some itch was there üòÇ. I was more frustrated day-by-day

But then I come to know about a channel [Kunal](https://www.youtube.com/c/kunalkushwaha) Kushwaha who guides people through his awesome guides and advice. I got to know about OPEN-SOURCE, CONTRIBUTION TO OPEN SOURCE, etc. But I don't know much about it.

### Some resources to learn what is open-source and how to contribute in open-source!
