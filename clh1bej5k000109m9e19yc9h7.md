# What does this series contain? üëÄ

***Hello everyone*** üòâ***,***

Hope you all are fine. So In this series, we will learn and revise about a computer network, its history, how it is formed and currently at what level it emerges.

Join me on a journey to **unravel the mysteries of computer networks**, and unlock the power of seamless connectivity. üöÄ

In this series, we will explore the fascinating world of computer networks, and discover how they shape our digital lives.

"Are you ready to take your networking knowledge to the next level? This series is your passport to becoming a *network ninja*!

From the basics of *TCP/IP* to the latest trends in *cloud networking*, this series has got you covered.

Ok, So let's start üî•üöÄ

# History of Internet üëá

So initially, On **October 1959**, something 50 years ago, Charley Kline, who is a student at UCLA (University of California Los Angeles), sent the first ever message over a network called ARPANET (the predecessor of the internet).

## What is Cold War? **‚ú®**

The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, which lasted from the end of World War II in 1945 until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. During this time, both superpowers engaged in a global competition for economic, military, and technological supremacy.

The development of the ARPANET in the 1960s was a direct result of this Cold War rivalry, as the U.S. government sought to create a secure and reliable means of communication that could withstand a potential nuclear attack from the Soviet Union.

So Russia wins this cold war by launching the **first artificial satellite, Sputnik**, in 1957.

The **ARPANET was funded** by the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), which was established in response to the Soviet Union's launch of the first artificial satellite.

## What is ARPANET? üëá

ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the first operational packet-switching network and the predecessor of the modern Internet. It was developed in the late 1960s by the **United States Department of Defense** (DOD).

So, DOD sponsored major research work for the development of initial protocols, languages and frameworks called **Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA)** for network communication

üëâ Firstly, **Four Nodes** were there are

* University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)
    
* Standford Research Institue (SRI)
    
* University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB)
    
* University of Utah

Now, On October 1959, Kline sent the first message to Bill Duval of Stanford University and he send the message **"login"**. But the system crashed after he typed the letter "o", and thus the first ever message sent over the Internet was, **"lo"**. Humble beginnings, right? üéâ

The ARPA was generally created by **U.S. President Eisenhower** whose goal was to research and develop new frontiers in tech and science.

In 1966, ARPA gave **$1 million** to fund a new computer networking project, which they named **ARPANET.** üëè

ARPANET was originally meant solely for just U.S. Military Communication and was built to connect all computers and allow them to transfer files and data seamlessly through physical cables and packets.

## History of Email üëÄ**‚ù§Ô∏è**

Now In 1971, Ray Tomlinson, a computer engineer, sent the first email while working on ARPANET. üëè

He used the @ symbol to create a unique identifier for the recipient and changed the way we communicate online forever.

In the 1980s, email became popular in business and academic circles due to its faster and more efficient communication capabilities compared to traditional mail and phone calls.

## The early 1980s ‚Äî The Internet is Born üöÄ**‚ú®**

As ARPANET quickly expanded across the world, so in 1974, the term "Internet" as a shorthand for internetworking was coined in an RFC document. This document can still be found [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc675).

ARPANET became public in 1982, and no longer use for government purposes. This provided worldwide public access to ARPANET.

Faster speed and new protocols are expanded and as the 1980s came to a close, ARPANET was growing rapidly.

## 1990 - The World Wide Web üéÑüöÄ

In 1989, British computer scientist **Tim Berners-Lee** proposed the concept of the World Wide Web, which he envisioned as a way to share information electronically among researchers.

While working at **CERN** (European nuclear research agency), Berners-Lee developed the first web browser and editor, called **World Wide Web**, which was released in 1991. This allowed users to view web pages and create their content.

The WWW allowed computers to share **hypertext** and other documents through the Internet, with various extra features such as **URLs** (universal resource locators). Documents on the Web could be accessed using software called a **"web browser"**.

### What does HyperText mean and What is HTML? üëá

Just Simple Hyper means beyond so Hypertext means beyond the text

what is beyond the text??? ***Hyperlink*** ............

So in this way, the concept of www emerged that we can connect all networks to a global single network so everyone can connect and communicate with each other.

The [first website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html), which provided information about the World Wide Web project, went live in 1991.

In 1993, the first widely-used web browser, Mosaic, was released, making the web more accessible to the general public.

In 1998, the first Google search engine was launched, making it easier to find information on the web.

In the early 2000s, the **dot-com bubble burst**, leading to a shakeout in the web industry.

### What is Dot-com Bubble (.com)?

The dot-com bubble was a time when people believed that any company with a website and a ".com" domain name could make a lot of money.

So, Investors put a lot of money into these companies, even if they didn't have a good business plan or financial stability. This led to a lot of growth in the tech industry, but when the bubble burst, many companies failed and investors lost a lot of money.

However, this time also led to many important innovations like online shopping, advertising, and social media.

## The early 1990s ‚Äî Netscape becomes the first "Internet Company"

Mosaic grew so popular that the programmers at NSCA, led by **Marc Andreessen**, a young programmer from Iowa, quit starting a new company with a new web browser.

They called the new browser **Netscape Navigator**, and the company, **Netscape.** Netscape quickly gained a huge majority in the browser market and became a public company in August 1995. On their first day of initial stock trading, Netscape's share price soared from **$28 to $75,** making Marc Andreessen and other Netscape founders **millionaires overnight.** And thus, Netscape became the first "Internet Company".

## Today ‚Äî The Internet Truly Connects All of Us

Today, the internet has become an integral part of our daily lives, connecting people from all corners of the world like never before. With the click of a button, we can communicate with loved ones across the globe, access vast amounts of information, and conduct business with anyone, anywhere.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1682730647813/0c084329-e43c-484e-94ea-332175b326cc.jpeg align="center")

The internet has opened up new opportunities for education, entertainment, and social connection, breaking down barriers and bringing people together in once unimaginable ways.

From social media to video conferencing, the internet has revolutionized the way we interact with each other and has become an essential tool for communication and collaboration in today's globalized world.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the history of the internet is a fascinating story that has changed the world in ways that we could not have imagined just a few decades ago.

From its origins as a military communication tool, the internet has grown into a global network that connects people and information from all corners of the world. It has revolutionized the way we live, work, and communicate, and has opened up new opportunities for education, entertainment, and social connection.

While there are certainly concerns and challenges associated with the internet, it has the potential to bring us all closer together and foster innovation and progress. As we continue to explore the possibilities of this transformative technology, it's important to remember the pioneers who paved the way and to use the internet responsibly and ethically for the betterment of society.
