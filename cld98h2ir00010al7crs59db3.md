### Let's see what is so special about javascript, what we can achieve from it .

## What is Javascript?

JavaScript was initially created for "**web pages to make alive** " means it should interact on some events and some user's action because HTML and CSS are just fot **structuring** and **styling** our webpages.

* In this language the programs are called scripts.
    
* They can be written in 2 ways either in **&lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt;** tag and other is to write javaScript in **another file**.
    
* When the page loads the programs will **automatically run** because of JS Engine is installed in every browser
    
* Scripts are executed as plain text, they don't require any special preparation unlike in java we have to compile then .class file is created then we have to run
    
* **Compilation and Interpretation process** is happen in javaScript also but it is **abstract in JS Engine**, will cover later in this series
    

## Why it is called as JavaScript?

* So basically, when javaScript was created, it initially had another name called "**TypeScript**".
    
* But at that time Java was more popular, so for some **marketing purpose** this named was given. But as of now JavaScript is more evolved, JavaScript became **fully independent language** with its own specification called "**ECMAScript**" and now it has no relation with Java at all.
    

Today, JavaScript can execute not only **in the browser**, but also **on the server**, or actually **on any device** that has a special program called **the JavaScript Engine**

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a "**JavaScript virtual machine**".

Different engines have different "**codenames**". For example:

* **V8** – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.
    
* **SpiderMonkey** – in Firefox.
    
* …There are other codenames like “**Chakra**” for IE, “**JavaScriptCore**”, “**Nitro**” and “**SquirrelFish**” for Safari, etc.
